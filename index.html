                <h2>Beyblade X's Parts</h2>
                <p>Beyblade X is the latest installment in the long-running Beyblade franchise, which has continually evolved with new systems, designs, and gameplay mechanics since its inception. 
                    With Beyblade X, the series introduces a revamped system, offering new customization options and dynamic battles for both seasoned players and newcomers. 
                    Like previous iterations, Beyblade X spinning tops—commonly referred to as Beys—are composed of several essential parts, each serving a specific function in the top's overall performance. 
                    These parts work together to define the Beyblade's attack power, stamina, defense, and movement patterns during battles.</p>

                <p>The Beyblade X system is designed to be modular, allowing players to swap and customize parts to match their playstyle or strategy for any given matchup. 
                    This modularity means that, like its predecessors, Beyblade X is a game of not just physical skill in launching the Beyblade, but also strategic assembly and customization. 
                    Each part contributes to different aspects of performance, and understanding these components is key to mastering the game.</p>

                <h2>1. Blade</h2>
                <p>This is the main offensive part of the Beyblade. It's responsible for attacking the opponent's top and making contact during battle. 
                    The design of the Blade determines the attack power, type of movement, and overall strategy of the Beyblade.</p>

                <p>The Ratchet acts as a weight disc between the Blade and the Base. It provides weight and balance to the Beyblade. 
                    Depending on its design and weight distribution, it can influence the Beyblade's stamina, attack power, or defense.</p>

                <p>the Bit (also known as the Tip or Driver in some systems) is a key component located at the bottom of the Beyblade. 
                    The Bit controls how the Beyblade interacts with the stadium, dictating its movement pattern, speed, stability, and stamina.</p>

            <h2>Launcher</h2>
            <p>The launcher in Beyblade X is a tool used to spin and release the Beyblade into battle. 
                Players pull a ripcord or string attached to the launcher, which generates the spinning motion for the top. 
                The launcher plays a vital role in determining how fast and powerfully the Beyblade is launched into the stadium, affecting its overall performance in the battle. 
                Launchers are available in different styles, with some designed for stronger and more controlled launches. 
                They can also support different spin directions, such as right-spin or left-spin, depending on the Beyblade being used.</p>

            <h2>Xtreme Stadium</h2>
            <p>The Xtreme Stadium in Beyblade X is the official arena where Beyblade battles occur. 
                It features a sloped or curved design that directs tops toward the center, creating high-speed collisions and exciting gameplay. 
                The stadium is designed to enhance the chance of Beyblades bursting or getting knocked out, adding to the intensity of battles. 
                Its layout encourages aggressive, action-packed matches, making each battle more dynamic and unpredictable.</p>
